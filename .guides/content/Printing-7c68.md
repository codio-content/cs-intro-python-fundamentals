## Newline Character
The `print` command automatically adds a newline character each time you use it. This is the default behavior. The code below will not print the two words on the same line. Enter the code below (or copy/paste the code) and click the `TRY IT` button.

```python
print("Hello")
print("world")
```

The text in red shows the newline character which is added even if you do not type it. (The newline character is what is inserted when you press "Enter" or "Return").

## Removing the Newline Character
Add `, end=''` (two quotes with nothing between them) to your `print` command. This overrides the default newline character.

```python
print("Hello ", end='')
print("world")
```

## What happens if you:
* Use double quotes instead of single quotes with `end=''`
* Use `end='\t'` in the `print` command
* Use `end='!'` in the `print` command
