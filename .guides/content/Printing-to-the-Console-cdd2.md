## Printing to the console
As you learn Python, you will write code in the text editor to the left. Use a `print` command to see the output of your program. Enter the code below (or copy/paste the code) and click the `TRY IT` button.

```python
print("Hello world")
```

{Try it}(python3 code/fundamentals/playground-printing.py 1)

The reason you were able to see the words appear is because of the `print` command.  Change your code to look like this and run it again.

```python
"Hello world"
```
{Try it}(python3 code/fundamentals/playground-printing.py 2)
