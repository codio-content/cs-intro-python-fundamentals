Integers (often called ints) are whole numbers. They can be positive or negative. Do not use a comma when typing large numbers

  <summary><b>5 vs. "5"</b></summary>
  <code>5</code> is not the same thing as <code>"5"</code>. The first one is an integer, the second is a string. You will see in a later lesson the different operations you can perform on strings and numbers. Treating a string as a number can cause errors.
